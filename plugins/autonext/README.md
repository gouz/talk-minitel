# SliDesk Plugin: AutoNext

This plugin lets you add a timer to automatically advance to the next slide.

To allow that, you need to add a class on the slide, prefixed with `auto-`.

```
## My slide .[auto-1312]

This slide change to next slide after 1312 ms (plus the animation duration, so 1612 ms (with default value)).
```
